# Coding-Quiz

### User Story
As a User I am looking for a web page that will provide me a quick quiz that is related to software development. This quiz should be timed and each question should have multiple choice answers. When I choose and answer, I should see a message if that answer was correct or incorrect, and the next question should appear. If I answer a question incorrectly, I should get a time penalty of ten seconds. After answering all questions I should se emy final score. If i run out of time the quiz should be stopped. This score should then be saved in local storage. I should be able to see the high score on the page.
### Features
This is a web application coding quiz
This quiz features questions with multiple choice answers.
When the quiz is started a countdown timer is started as well.
After answering each questions the user is notified if their answer was correct or incorrect.
A score is kept after answering all questions or if the timer runs out.
Localstorage keeps the high score and it can be viewed anytime on the page.
